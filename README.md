# wildfire-writing
A FLOSS writing software in the vein of campfire write and world anvil. Currently this application has no features however I have several planned(those being: rendered timelines, a 
view mode to visualise connections between different parts of the worldbuilding and markdown support.)

#### Features
 - A GUI
 - more coming

# How to contribute
#### For programmers
- create a issue with the code enclosed and a title starting with ["CODE"]

#### For anyone else
- report bugs and suggest features
