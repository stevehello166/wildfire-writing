# wildfire-writing
A FLOSS writing software in the vein of campfire write and world anvil. Currently this application has no features however I have several planned(those being: rendered timelines, a 
view mode to visualise connections between different parts of the worldbuilding and markdown support.) Currently it uses fltk-decl as the gui library 

#### Features
 - A GUI
 - A manuscript editor(no spell check yet)
