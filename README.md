# wildfire-writing
A FLOSS writing software in the vein of campfire write and world anvil. Currently this application has no features however I have several planned(those being: rendered timelines, a 
view mode to visualise connections between different parts of the worldbuilding and markdown support.)

ps. I think what the folks at campfire write and world anvil are doing is pretty cool, I am only making this because A, opensource on top and B, I'm broke.
